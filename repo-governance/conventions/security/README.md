# Security Conventions

Everything here guards one of three concerns: what enters version history, which no later commit takes back; who may
read real values; and what leaves the repository, which no later deletion recalls.

| Convention                                                        | Governs                                                                          |

| [No Secrets in Tracked Files](no-secrets-in-tracked-files.md)     | where credentials live, whatever the visibility, and what remediates a leak      |
| [No Machine-Specific Values](no-machine-specific-values.md)       | keeping one machine's paths, names, and addresses out of commits                 |
| [Environment Variable Contract](environment-variable-contract.md) | the committed key template, key naming, validation, and the secret census        |
| [Agent Environment-File Access](agent-env-file-access.md)         | which real environment files an agent never reads, writes, or edits by any route |
| [Public Outbound Safety](public-outbound-safety.md)               | what must be screened before anything is published                               |
