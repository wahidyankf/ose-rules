# Enforcement Layers

| Layer                   | Stops                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| harness permission deny | agent file tools on restricted paths                              |
| pre-tool hook           | the same, plus shell commands that name a restricted file         |
| staged-file guard       | a real file reaching a commit, from any actor                     |
| this convention         | what the layers above cannot see, such as an agent-written script |

A guard matching command text is best-effort, and documented as such: it cannot recognize a filename assembled from
innocent pieces.

A new agent harness is supported only once equivalent enforcement exists for it, including pre-tool enforcement. A
harness that cannot provide it is recorded as unenforced rather than assumed covered.
