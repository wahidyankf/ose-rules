# Harness Quality Gate

This gate follows the [Quality Gate Contract](../../development/workflow/quality-gate-contract.md): a read-only checker,
a frozen ledger, one separate writer, at most three cycles, and an advisory verdict. It judges upstream drift only:
whether the committed bindings still match what each harness documents today. Whether the bindings agree with their own
canonical source is parity, which [Harness Parity Verification](harness-parity-verification.md) and the adapter
validator own.

## Entry

The gate starts only on an explicit request that names it. No workflow calls it. The repository declares at least one
supported harness.

## Inputs

| Input        | Type    | Values                                   | Default  |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `subject`    | string  | `all` declared harnesses, or one by name | required |
| `mode`       | enum    | `lax`, `normal`, `strict`, `all`         | `normal` |
| `max-cycles` | integer | 1, 2, or 3                               | 3        |

The frozen subject records the revision and, per harness, the committed files that bind it: adapters, harness
configuration, and any reference record kept of that harness's conventions. Any other `max-cycles` value, or a missing
subject, refuses to start.

## Deterministic Boundary

The checker reports none of these properties. The entry and exit checks run their owners instead.

| Property                                   | Owned by                 | This catalog runs                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Adapters match their canonical definitions | the adapter validator    | `rhino harness adapters validate` |
| Canonical agent and skill front matter     | the metadata validator   | `rhino metadata validate`         |
| Markdown formatting                        | the formatter and linter | `prettier`, `markdownlint-cli2`   |

A red adapter validator is a red entry check, repaired at its cause before cycle 1, never a finding. An adopting
repository replaces the last column with the tools its declared gate runs.

## Cycle

Each cycle is one full audit by `harness-checker`, loading the `checking-harness-compatibility` skill, and one repair by
`harness-propagation`, run by `harness-fixer`, per
[Sequence and Termination](../../development/workflow/quality-gate-contract/002-sequence-and-termination.md).

The audit researches each harness in the subject, one task per harness, in parallel because none reads another's result,
handed over as [Web Research Delegation](../../development/agents/web-research-delegation.md) requires. Each task
returns file locations, metadata keys, model identifier format, permission schema, and breaking changes, citing each
fact's authoritative source and retrieval date. Disagreeing sources come back as a conflict, not a choice.

The checker compares the research with the reference record and the committed bindings. Each difference is a finding
with its local path and upstream citation.

The writer repairs drift the evidence settles unambiguously, such as a renamed metadata key or a moved file location, in
the canonical artifact, the generator mapping, or the reference record, then regenerates the adapters. A source
conflict, a change to a permission's meaning, a harness addition or removal, and a generator logic change are
`needs-decision`, with evidence.

## Termination

The contract's
[termination table](../../development/workflow/quality-gate-contract/002-sequence-and-termination.md#termination)
applies unchanged. This gate adds no row.

## Verdict

| Verdict              | The caller                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PASS`               | records the verdict and continues                                                   |
| `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS` | records the verdict and the open non-blocking rows, and continues                   |
| `FAIL`               | gives each open blocking row an owner (idea brief, plan item, or issue), continues  |
| `BLOCKED`            | records the cause (tooling, input-changed, or unavailable), then acts as for `FAIL` |

No verdict stops the caller.

## Ledger

`local-tmp/quality/harness/<subject-slug>__<YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ>.md`, with the columns and closing verdict block in
[the contract](../../development/workflow/quality-gate-contract/003-verdicts-ledger-and-relations.md#ledger). Each row
keeps its upstream citation and retrieval date. It is never committed.

## Example Usage

```text
Run harness-quality-gate on subject all with mode strict.
```

## A Check Cannot See Upstream

A repository check compares files the repository holds, so it cannot notice that a harness changed its configuration
format last week. Research can, but it is slow and networked, so it runs on a cadence the adopter chooses: a schedule
catches unannounced changes and runs when nothing changed; running on announced releases costs nothing idle and misses
the rest. This workflow implements [Evidence Over Assertion](../../principles/evidence-over-assertion.md), because every
upstream fact is cited and every repair re-validated.
