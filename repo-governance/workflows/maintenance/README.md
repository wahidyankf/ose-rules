# Maintenance Workflows

Work produces debris: scratch files, reports, branches, worktrees, generated output. None of it is a mistake while the
work is happening. All of it is a mistake once the work is done.

A repository also drifts while nobody works in it: dependencies age, releases wait, and rules pile up copies. The rest
of these workflows keep it current, releasable, and governed by rules written in one place. The propagations that write
rules and documents sit in [`quality/`](../quality/README.md), beside the gates that judge them.
