# Parity Planning

## Entry

An objective must hold across two or more repositories in a parity relationship per
[Related Repositories](../../conventions/structure/related-repositories.md), and the request for plans is explicit per
[Authorization and Execution Record](../../conventions/structure/plans/010-authorization-and-execution-record.md).

- `objective` (`string`, required): the shared change.
- `repositories` (`string`, required): the parity set, at least two members.
- `target-stage` (`enum`: `backlog`, `in-progress`; optional, default the adopter's recorded stage).

## Sequence

1. **Record the parity identity before any mutation.** One plan identifier, worktree name, and branch name serve every
   repository; one whose route needs neither records `not applicable` and why. Reuse an existing worktree or branch only
   with proof it belongs to this objective; otherwise choose one free common name.
2. **Survey each repository from its files.** Read the state the objective touches, never from memory. A survey older
   than the latest change in its repository is run again.
3. **Build the deviation matrix.** Every difference found is one row: the dimension, each repository's current state,
   and candidate resolutions: align, deviate deliberately, or drop. Two rows are always present: where each repository
   keeps its rationale, and which local constraints, such as access or delivery, bind each side.
4. **Run the first decision gate.** Every row receives a decision and a justification per
   [Decision Gates](../../development/agents/planning-capabilities/003-decision-gates.md), and a row needing outside
   evidence is flagged. No plan is authored while a row is undecided.
5. **Research the flagged rows,** citing authoritative sources. With none flagged, record that research was skipped and
   why.
6. **Run the second decision gate** on what research found. A finding that contradicts a decision reopens its row, and
   authoring waits until every row is decided again.
7. **Author one plan per repository** through [Planning](plan-planning.md), under the shared identifier. Each plan
   carries the full matrix with its decisions, links to its sibling plans, an item writing the rationale where the
   matrix placed it, an item updating any governance the decisions change, and its own knowledge capture. No plan says
   how a sibling performs its work, per
   [Delivery Seams and Ownership](../../development/agents/planning-capabilities/005-delivery-seams-and-ownership.md).
8. **Gate each plan separately** with the [Quality Gate](plan-quality-gate.md). One plan's verdict never stands in for
   another's.
9. **Land each plan by its own repository's route** once its actual worktree and branch names match the identity record.
   Each repository resolves its delivery independently, and its own checks prove only its own side.
10. **Report the deviation count:** deliberate and silent deviations, silent being zero.

## Exit

Every repository in the set holds a plan with a terminal quality-gate verdict, and every matrix row carries a decision
and its justification.

Outputs: `plans` (`directory` per repository, `plans/<target-stage>/<identifier>/`), `deviation-matrix` (`table`,
embedded in each plan), `identity` (`record`: identifier, worktree, and branch per repository), and the deviation count.

Partial outcome: a repository whose plan did not pass keeps its draft and the blocking finding, while the other plans
stand. A difference found after authoring that no row covers reopens step 3 for every plan. The run fails when a gate is
abandoned with a row undecided.

## Example Usage

```text
Run plan-parity-planning with objective "align the error codes" and repositories "web-app mobile-app".
```

## Related Workflows

- [Planning](plan-planning.md) authors each repository's plan.
- [Execution](plan-execution.md) runs each landed plan inside its own repository.
- [Multi-Plans Execution](multi-plans-execution.md) schedules the resulting plans together.

## Adopter Decision: Plans Only or Through Delivery

| Option                  | After the plans land                                                                                                                       | Trade-off                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| plans only              | each plan waits for its own Execution run                                                                                                  | every plan can be reviewed before work starts; one more hand-off  |
| continue into execution | Execution starts once every plan has landed and a decision gate settles order, failure policy, open decisions, and human-step availability | one run from matrix to delivered parity; no separate review pause |

Record the default. Either way, each repository keeps its own delivery route, gates, and cleanup.

## Why Every Difference Is a Row

Parity drifts through differences nobody chose. Recording each one with a decision makes divergence reviewable, so a
later reader can tell a deliberate deviation from a lapse. Each run is bounded by its matrix and its two gates. This
workflow implements [Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/explicit-over-implicit.md) and
[Evidence Over Assertion](../../principles/evidence-over-assertion.md).
