# Quality Gate Results

A gate runs against a frozen snapshot and returns exactly one result:

| Result               | Means                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PASS`               | nothing outstanding                                           |
| `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS` | findings exist, each has an explicit disposition, none blocks |
| `FAIL`               | at least one blocking finding remains open                    |
| `BLOCKED`            | the gate could not judge: red tooling, changed input, no tool |

## No Polling State

There is no other value. "Running", "pending a fix", "almost passing", and "re-run and see" are not results — they are
the absence of one, and every one of them lets work continue past a gate that never closed.

The gate is not re-run until it agrees. It runs once, findings are repaired within the budget, and the outcome is
decided.

## The Snapshot Is Frozen

A gate that re-reads a changing draft is measuring a moving target and cannot state what it verified. Record the
revision with any uncommitted paths, and its commit identifier when one exists; that revision is what the result is
about.

## Bounded Repair

The repair bound, the progress rule, and what happens at the ceiling are set once by the
[Quality Gate Contract](../../workflow/quality-gate-contract.md). Each cycle repairs against the frozen finding list,
and the count of open blocking findings must strictly decrease — a cycle that changes which findings exist without
reducing how many is not progress.

## An Empty Report Is Not a Completion Predicate

The temptation is to iterate until the checker returns nothing. That state is always reachable, by repair or by
attrition, and reaching it says nothing about quality.

What the bound forces instead is the useful question: is this good enough to proceed? The verdict answers it, and every
answer is terminal.

## `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS` Requires Dispositions

It is admissible only when each residual finding carries an explicit disposition — accepted with a reason, deferred to a
named owner, or judged not applicable.

Without that, it becomes a way to record `FAIL` in a form that reads like success.
