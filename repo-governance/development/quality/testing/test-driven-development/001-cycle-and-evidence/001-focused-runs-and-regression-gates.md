description: >-
  Defines case selection and execution proof for local test-first cycles while preserving full regression at phase and
  pre-pull-request boundaries, with full end-to-end scheduling and batching.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when choosing a cycle command, recording filtered-run evidence, planning full regression gates, or scheduling
  end-to-end runs.

# Focused Runs and Regression Gates

Reason: keep local feedback short without weakening test-first proof or delivery verification, following
[Evidence Over Assertion](../../../../../principles/evidence-over-assertion.md) and
[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../../../../../principles/deliberate-problem-solving.md).

- During a TDD cycle, run only the check covering the current item to demonstrate Red and Green. Do not run the block to
  prove a single item. An item is one mini test-driven cycle or one delivery checklist item. A block is the whole
  automated suite except end-to-end.
- After each refactor, run the named regression selection covering the changed behaviour and its affected shared
  boundary, rather than a full-suite run for every item.
- At the end of each plan phase, and before PR ready-for-review or session end as a safety net, run the whole automated
  suite except full E2E, including the mandatory fast gate with coverage, plus only the affected E2E flow. Hooks already
  enforce the affected scope at push time; the phase boundary is where the whole-check pays off. The same passing proof
  may cover both boundaries while its tested scope remains unchanged.
- Run the full E2E suite on its scheduled CI workflow (CRON) by default in every repository that has E2E; keep local E2E
  selective to the touched flow. Repositories without E2E, such as libraries and CLIs, carry no such schedule.
- Never require a full E2E run as a completion condition for plan execution or a plan phase; full E2E is a separately
  batched set.
- Record executed case identities and a positive executed-test count for every filtered cycle run. Zero tests, unmatched
  filters, and cached results that did not execute the intended cases are not proof.

Use runner-level case/file filters. A filtered run must not enforce whole-project coverage on code it intentionally does
not execute: use a separate focused runner invocation without that coverage mode, leaving the full coverage target and
its floor unchanged. Preserve required build/code-generation, resource admission, real-resource ownership, and cleanup
guards.

Existing test-first layers, exceptions, coverage floors, hooks, and continuous-integration contracts remain unchanged.
Full integration/end-to-end runs remain separate from the fast gate.

**Followed observations:** red and green execute only the current item's check, failing and passing on the intended
behaviour assertion; refactor executes affected-boundary cases and passes; phase/pre-PR proof records a passing
whole-suite run except full E2E plus the affected E2E flow; full E2E passes on its schedule; no plan or phase gate names
a full-E2E run as its completion condition; every filtered run records positive execution counts.

**Violated observations:** a per-item unfiltered command executes unrelated cases; refactor omits a named
affected-boundary case; boundary proof substitutes filtered cases for the mandatory whole-suite run or runs the full E2E
suite locally instead of the affected flow; a plan or phase completion waits on a full-E2E run; or runner output
positively reports zero matched tests.

**Enforcement disposition — unenforced by decision:** the smallest meaningful selection, the affected E2E flow, and the
E2E schedule depend on behaviour and boundary context. Plan and execution review inspect commands, executed identities,
counts, and boundary records; no mechanical scanner or gate coverage of local selection, execution order, or schedule
presence is claimed.
