# Git Author Identity

Authorship is a claim about who did the work, and once pushed it is permanent. Identity therefore comes from one
declared place per person, never from a setting tucked inside a single repository.

This standard implements [Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/explicit-over-implicit.md) and
[Reproducibility](../../principles/reproducibility.md).

## Why a Local Override Is the Hazard

Git reads a repository's local configuration after the user's, and the last value read wins. A `[user]` block stored
locally therefore wins for every commit made in that repository. It asks for no confirmation, prints nothing when a
commit is made, and stays until someone removes it, so a wrong identity can accumulate over many commits before anyone
reads the log. Correcting authorship that was already pushed means rewriting published history.

## The Rule

1. **No repository-local identity.** A repository's local configuration holds no `user.name` and no `user.email`. Any
   value is a violation, including one matching the person's real identity, because the mechanism is the fault rather
   than the value.
2. **User-level configuration only.** Identity resolves from the person's own git configuration, in the home directory
   or the XDG location. System-level configuration is reserved for shared automation hosts. A pipeline may set its
   service identity in its own definition, by variables or a write to its own checkout's configuration, which rule 1
   does not cover; that is platform configuration, not an agent setting identity, and the local check below skips that
   checkout.
3. **More than one identity through conditional includes.** A person needing a different identity for a group of
   repositories adds an `includeIf "gitdir:<directory>/"` entry to their user-level configuration, pointing at a file
   that sets it. For a single commit, `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`, and
   `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` override configuration without writing to any file.
4. **Agents never set identity.** No agent runs `git config user.*` at any scope, edits a `[user]` block, or supplies
   identity through the environment. An agent that finds a local override stops and reports it; removing it is the
   person's decision.

```ini
# user-level git configuration
[user]
    name = <person-name>
    email = <personal-email>

[includeIf "gitdir:<work-directory>/"]
    path = <work-identity-file>
```

## Checking and Removing

In a compliant repository, `git config --local --get-regexp '^user\.'` prints nothing. A person removing an override
runs `git config --local --unset user.name` and `git config --local --unset user.email`, then
`git config --local --remove-section user` once the section is empty, and repeats the check.

## Enforcement

For agents the rule is behavioural and lives in their instructions. An adopter wanting a mechanical check adds the query
above to its own pre-commit hook. The check must read local configuration only, so that a conditional include in
user-level configuration still passes.
