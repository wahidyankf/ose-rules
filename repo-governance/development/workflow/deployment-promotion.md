  Separates delivering a change to the trunk from deploying it: each deployed project is promoted by moving its own
  pointer branch, gated so no other push builds it, confirmed by the finished build, and cut over to a domain
  separately.
when_to_use: >-
  Use when adding or changing deployment configuration, promoting a commit to an environment, deciding whether
  automation may promote, or pointing a domain at a project.

# Deployment Promotion

Landing on the trunk delivers a change; it does not deploy it. A deployment is a separate promotion of one chosen trunk
commit to one environment of one project, and every part of it is explicit.

Scoped to adopters whose hosting platform builds each deployed project from a branch; tag, pipeline, and built-artifact
promotion are out of scope.

This standard implements [Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/explicit-over-implicit.md) and
[Evidence Over Assertion](../../principles/evidence-over-assertion.md). Development branches follow
[Integration Path](integration-path.md); the pointers here are the environment branches it keeps apart from development.

## Promotion Pointers

- **One pointer branch per deployed project and environment,** named after both, such as `prod-<project>`. A shared name
  would let one project's promotion build another.
- **A pointer receives no commits.** It only ever moves to a commit already on the trunk, and the platform builds from
  it; nobody deploys a locally built artifact.
- **A lagging pointer is normal:** newer commits are delivered, not yet promoted.
- **Forward moves only.** Promoting a newer trunk commit fast-forwards the pointer. Any other move is a force update
  that follows [No Destructive Git Operations](no-destructive-git-operations.md), so a rollback is a revert on the
  trunk, promoted forward.

## Who Moves a Pointer

A production pointer moves only by a deliberate promotion of a chosen commit, made by whoever the adopter records as
holding deployment authority. No workflow, hook, scheduled job, or plan step advances it, because an automatic advance
would turn every landing into a deployment. Before it moves, the commit is on the trunk with its gates passed, and a
promotion run from a checkout starts on the trunk with a clean working tree.

For a non-production tier the adopter records one option:

| Option           | The pointer moves when                                                             | Trade-off                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| deliberate only  | someone promotes it, as for production                                             | every environment changes by choice, and the tier lags until someone acts                                                                                             |
| gated automation | a workflow has run the full test suite on a trunk commit and passed, then moves it | the tier tracks the trunk with evidence attached; a bypass, allowed only while the gate itself is broken and the tier must ship urgently, is recorded with its reason |

## Build Gating

Each project builds only from its own pointer. A build started by any other ref is cancelled before it runs, for example
by a platform's ignored-build step comparing the building branch with the pointer's name, so trunk pushes spend no
deploys and one promotion never builds another project.

The platform's own production-branch setting must name the same pointer. That setting lives in the platform, not in the
repository, and a mismatch deadlocks silently: trunk pushes start production builds the gate cancels, and pointer pushes
produce previews that never reach the domain. Check it when a project is first connected and after any reconnect, which
can reset it to the default branch.

## A Push Is Not a Deploy

The platform builds asynchronously; from the push, failure and success look identical.

1. Find the deployment whose commit matches the promoted commit. A newest deployment for an older commit means the build
   has not started.
2. Follow it to a terminal state, as [Remote Status Polling](remote-status-polling.md) requires.
3. Report ready with its address, failed with the failing build step, or cancelled, usually by a newer promotion.
4. Where the platform's status cannot be read, say so and fall back to the pointer's pipeline result and a request
   against the live address. Never report success on the push alone.

Name a project by its readable name, never an opaque platform identifier, in messages and committed artifacts.

## Domain Cutover

Pointing a live domain at a project is a separately authorized act. Landing deployment configuration does not authorize
it, and neither does a passing gate. Configuration may be committed for a project whose pointer does not exist yet; the
missing pointer keeps it inert.

Deployment configuration names each secret's variable and where it is set, never its value, per
[Environment Variable Contract](../../conventions/security/environment-variable-contract.md).
