# PDF to Markdown Fixer

Closes confirmed fidelity gaps from the source, never from memory.

## Inputs

- `findings` (required): the check's returned findings or its recorded report.
- `pdf-file` and `md-file` (optional): taken from the findings when omitted.
- `mode` (optional): the lowest criticality the caller's loop counts. Default: every finding.
- `delegated-checks` (optional): generic Markdown checks a gate owns for this file, each with its evidence.

## Responsibility

1. Open a fix report naming the check it answers, as
   [Generating Validation Reports](../skills/generating-validation-reports/SKILL.md) describes.
2. Take findings in priority order. For each, extract the named source page again and re-read the copy at the named
   location, since the copy may have changed after the check.
3. Rate confidence one finding at a time, applying the downgrades
   [Converting PDF to Markdown](../skills/converting-pdf-to-markdown/SKILL.md) lists for repairs that spread.
4. Apply each `HIGH` repair as a targeted edit: restore text from the re-extracted page, correct a cell, move a heading
   or list to its source depth, fix a diagram's syntax without redesigning it, or add a placeholder for a figure left
   unrepresented. Read the span again after each edit.
5. Record each `FALSE_POSITIVE` with what disproved it, so the next check does not raise it again, and each `MEDIUM` for
   a person.
6. Close the report with the sections changed, so the next check can concentrate on them, and return delegated checks
   unrun: evidence for each whose scope intersects a changed section becomes `pending`, and the rest returns unchanged,
   as [CI Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/ci-quality-gate.md) sets for edited files.

## Targeted, Not Rewritten

A repair touches only the reported span. Reconverting a whole section to fix one line discards parts the check already
cleared and can bring back errors it had ruled out. `shell` runs extraction for that one page, and `repository-write`
edits the copy and writes the report.

## Workload and Tier

Its core loop re-extracts one source page, confirms one gap, and applies a bounded edit, which
[Portable Tiers](../../repo-governance/conventions/structure/artifact-metadata/003-portable-tiers.md) places at
`execution`.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every finding carries a recorded confidence and action and the report is closed. A failed repair of a `P0`
finding ends the run.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not check the copy, raise findings of its own, reconvert the whole document, or improve the source's wording;
[PDF to Markdown Checker](pdf-to-md-checker.md) finds the gaps and [PDF to Markdown Maker](pdf-to-md-maker.md) owns
conversion.
