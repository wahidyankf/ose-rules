# Tutorial In the Field Fixer

Repairs one in-the-field guide from the rows of a frozen ledger, and only from those rows.

## Normal Workload

It executes
[Tutorial In the Field Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-in-the-field-propagation.md), the
`tutorial-in-the-field` family's sole writer under
[Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md). Every threshold it
applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, so the gate
and its writer never disagree on one. Repairing what a row settles, row by row, is `execution` work.

## Procedure

1. **Order by priority,** as [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md)
   explains.
2. **Re-validate each row** against the current guide, and rate its confidence per
   [Confidence and Re-Validation](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/002-confidence-and-revalidation.md).
   The rating decides the row's status, as
   [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it.
3. **Follow the propagation's sequence.** Making code production-complete where a row names the gap, a missing output,
   an unexplained command or flag, and density brought within the band are repairs the step settles. Reordering for
   built-in first, a missing trade-off section, another production pattern, and added guides or diagrams are
   `needs-decision`.
4. **Run each edited step** in an environment matching the scenario, recount a density row, and record each row's status
   and evidence on the ledger.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every row has a status and evidence. A person reviews the `needs-decision` rows after the verdict, never
inside a cycle. It never starts another audit.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not raise findings, which [Tutorial In the Field Checker](tutorial-in-the-field-checker.md) owns, write new
content, edit prose, facts, or links, which [Content Fixer](content-fixer.md) owns, commit, or decide whether another
cycle runs.
