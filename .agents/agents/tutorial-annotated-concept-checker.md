# Tutorial Annotated Concept Checker

The `tutorial-annotated-concept` family's checker. It judges one annotated-concept tutorial for the
[Tutorial Annotated Concept Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-annotated-concept-quality-gate.md)
and reports. It changes nothing.

## Normal Workload

It reads the subject once, from the gate's own rules, since the catalog publishes no skill for this kind, and rates each
breach. Every threshold it applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, and without
an adapter only the generic rules apply. Validating against fixed criteria is `execution` work.

## What It Checks

The gate's cycle owns the questions; this checker answers them:

1. **Mode first:** the tutorial's declared mode holds, and a no-code tutorial containing a code block is a `CRITICAL`
   finding. Every later question branches on the mode.
2. **Each worked example** carries context saying why the concept matters, a fitting medium, a key takeaway, and any
   part the adapter adds; a code-bearing example runs as printed, and in no-code mode each decision artifact spells out
   its reasoning.
3. **Density:** comment lines divided by code lines per code-bearing example fall within the adapter's band.
4. **Across the tutorial,** worked examples cluster by theme and rise from simple to real-world, a diagram appears only
   where a visual relationship materially aids understanding, and the count meets the adapter's floor for the mode.

Medium fit, clustering, progression, and decision-artifact quality are judgement rows. Prose, facts, and links belong to
[Content Checker](content-checker.md), and properties in the gate's Deterministic Boundary are never findings.

## Findings

Each finding names the file and worked example, the rule or adapter threshold it breaks, what was observed, a measured
value where the rule is a band or floor, and a criticality from
[Criticality Levels](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/001-criticality-levels.md).
It returns findings to the gate, which records them in its ledger. Confidence is rated later by
[Tutorial Annotated Concept Fixer](tutorial-annotated-concept-fixer.md).

## Shell

`shell` lists files, counts comment and code lines, and runs an example through the repository's declared entry point in
a form that changes no tracked file.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every worked example in scope has been judged once and its findings are returned, or when the subject
cannot be read, reporting it as not run, never as clean.

## What It Does Not Do

It never edits a page or its code, rates confidence, holds a threshold of its own, judges prose, facts, or links, or
gives the gate's verdict.
