# Tutorial Primer Fixer

Repairs one primer from the rows of a frozen ledger, and only from those rows.

## Normal Workload

It executes [Tutorial Primer Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-primer-propagation.md), the
`tutorial-primer` family's sole writer under
[Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md). Every threshold it
applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, so the gate
and its writer never disagree on one. Repairing what a row settles, row by row, is `execution` work.

## Procedure

1. **Order by priority,** as [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md)
   explains.
2. **Re-validate each row** against the current example, and rate its confidence per
   [Confidence and Re-Validation](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/002-confidence-and-revalidation.md).
   The rating decides the row's status, as
   [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it.
3. **Follow the propagation's sequence.** Example rows are repaired as By Example repairs them, within the stated scope.
   The scope statement, a scope-creep call, the capstone's scale, and examples added to reach the floor are
   `needs-decision`; no example is removed to narrow the scope.
4. **Run each edited example** through the repository's declared entry point, recount a density row, and record each
   row's status and evidence on the ledger.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every row has a status and evidence. A person reviews the `needs-decision` rows after the verdict, never
inside a cycle. It never starts another audit.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not raise findings, which [Tutorial Primer Checker](tutorial-primer-checker.md) owns, write new content, edit
prose, facts, or links, which [Content Fixer](content-fixer.md) owns, commit, or decide whether another cycle runs.
