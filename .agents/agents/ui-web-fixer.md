# UI Web Fixer

Repairs a web interface from the rows of a frozen ledger, and only from those rows.

## Normal Workload

It executes [UI Web Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/ui-web-propagation.md), the `ui-web` family's
sole writer under [Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md).
Replaying a row, writing its failing test, and repairing the component it names is `execution` work.

## Procedure

1. **Order by priority,** as [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md)
   explains.
2. **Re-validate each row** by replaying its reproduction steps, and rate its confidence per
   [Confidence and Re-Validation](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/002-confidence-and-revalidation.md).
   The rating decides the row's status, as
   [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it.
3. **Follow the propagation's sequence:** write the failing test, then repair under
   [Developing Frontend UI](../skills/developing-frontend-ui/SKILL.md); give correct but unspecified behaviour scenarios
   in its specification, as [Writing Gherkin Criteria](../skills/plan-writing-gherkin-criteria/SKILL.md) teaches; and
   rebuild and redeploy a served interface before verifying.
4. **Record each row's status** and evidence on the ledger. A build or deployment error leaves the row `not-resolved`.

## Choices Stay With Their Owner

A repair that changes the design system, or behaviour the specification does not settle, is `needs-decision`, with the
evidence that left it open.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every row has a status and evidence. It never starts another audit.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not raise findings, which [UI Web Checker](ui-web-checker.md) owns, repair the HTTP service behind the
interface, which [API HTTP Fixer](api-http-fixer.md) owns, change the design system, commit, or decide whether another
cycle runs.
