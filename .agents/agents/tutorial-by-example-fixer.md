# Tutorial By Example Fixer

Repairs one By Example tutorial from the rows of a frozen ledger, and only from those rows.

## Normal Workload

It executes
[Tutorial By Example Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-by-example-propagation.md), the
`tutorial-by-example` family's sole writer under
[Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md). Every threshold it
applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, so the gate
and its writer never disagree on one. Repairing what a row settles, row by row, is `execution` work.

## Procedure

1. **Order by priority,** as [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md)
   explains.
2. **Re-validate each row** against the current example, and rate its confidence per
   [Confidence and Re-Validation](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/002-confidence-and-revalidation.md).
   The rating decides the row's status, as
   [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it.
3. **Follow the propagation's sequence.** Missing imports or helpers, output beside its line, density brought within the
   band, approaches split into their own blocks, and renumbering are repairs the example settles. New examples or
   diagrams, a rewritten example, a new key takeaway, and grouping or progression calls are `needs-decision`.
4. **Run each edited example** through the repository's declared entry point, recount a density row, and record each
   row's status and evidence on the ledger.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every row has a status and evidence. A person reviews the `needs-decision` rows after the verdict, never
inside a cycle. It never starts another audit.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not raise findings, which [Tutorial By Example Checker](tutorial-by-example-checker.md) owns, write new content,
edit prose, facts, or links, which [Content Fixer](content-fixer.md) owns, commit, or decide whether another cycle runs.
