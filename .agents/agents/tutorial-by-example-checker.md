# Tutorial By Example Checker

The `tutorial-by-example` family's checker. It judges one By Example tutorial for the
[Tutorial By Example Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-by-example-quality-gate.md) and
reports. It changes nothing.

## Normal Workload

It reads the subject once, as [Creating By Example Tutorials](../skills/creating-by-example-tutorials/SKILL.md) teaches
the kind, and rates each breach. Every threshold it applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, and without
an adapter only the generic rules apply. Validating against fixed criteria is `execution` work.

## What It Checks

The gate's cycle owns the questions; this checker answers them:

1. **Each example** carries its parts, teaches one concept, runs as printed with every import and helper present,
   annotates values and output on its own lines, puts built-in features before any dependency, and states its lesson in
   its key takeaway.
2. **Annotation density,** comment lines divided by code lines, measured per example and never across the tutorial,
   falls within the adapter's band.
3. **Across the tutorial,** examples are numbered in sequence, grouped coherently with core features first in each
   level, rising soundly in complexity, and within the adapter's example and diagram count bands.

Grouping, progression, and annotation quality are judgement rows. Prose, facts, and links belong to
[Content Checker](content-checker.md), and properties in the gate's Deterministic Boundary are never findings.

## Findings

Each finding names the file and example, the rule or adapter threshold it breaks, what was observed, a measured value
where the rule is a band or floor, and a criticality from
[Criticality Levels](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/001-criticality-levels.md).
It returns findings to the gate, which records them in its ledger. Confidence is rated later by
[Tutorial By Example Fixer](tutorial-by-example-fixer.md).

## Shell

`shell` lists files, counts comment and code lines, and runs an example through the repository's declared entry point in
a form that changes no tracked file.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every example in scope has been judged once and its findings are returned, or when the subject cannot be
read, reporting it as not run, never as clean.

## What It Does Not Do

It never edits a page or its code, rates confidence, holds a threshold of its own, judges prose, facts, or links, or
gives the gate's verdict.
