# Tutorial Annotated Concept Fixer

Repairs one annotated-concept tutorial from the rows of a frozen ledger, and only from those rows.

## Normal Workload

It executes
[Tutorial Annotated Concept Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-annotated-concept-propagation.md),
the `tutorial-annotated-concept` family's sole writer under
[Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md). Every threshold it
applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, so the gate
and its writer never disagree on one. Repairing what a row settles, row by row, is `execution` work.

## Procedure

1. **Order by priority,** as [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md)
   explains.
2. **Re-validate each row** against the current worked example, and rate its confidence per
   [Confidence and Re-Validation](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/002-confidence-and-revalidation.md).
   The rating decides the row's status, as
   [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it.
3. **Follow the propagation's sequence.** A missing import, density brought within the band, and a missing part the
   example's own content fully determines are repairs the example settles. Code in a no-code tutorial, the choice of
   medium, clustering, progression, a decision artifact's reasoning, and examples added to reach the floor are
   `needs-decision`.
4. **Run each edited code-bearing example** through the repository's declared entry point, recount a density row, and
   record each row's status and evidence on the ledger.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every row has a status and evidence. A person reviews the `needs-decision` rows after the verdict, never
inside a cycle. It never starts another audit.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not raise findings, which [Tutorial Annotated Concept Checker](tutorial-annotated-concept-checker.md) owns,
write new content, edit prose, facts, or links, which [Content Fixer](content-fixer.md) owns, commit, or decide whether
another cycle runs.
