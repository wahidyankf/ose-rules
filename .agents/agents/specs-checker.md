# Specs Checker

Audits specification folders and reports. It changes nothing.

## Normal Workload

For each listed folder it carries the structure check's results, reads indexes, features, architecture, and references
against the recorded layout, compares counterpart folders, and rates each breach. Judging content against the categories
and weightings its skill sets out is `execution` work.

## Input

`folders`: the specification folders to audit. Each is audited with its subfolders and nothing else; a folder a listed
one links to stays out of scope. Cross-folder consistency runs only when two or more are listed, as
[Specs Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/specs-quality-gate.md) requires.

## Adopter Decision: Layout and Structure Check

Repositories keep corpora in different layouts and differ in whether a script checks their structure. The checker
applies what the repository records.

| Choice          | Option             | The checker                                                                         | Trade-off                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| layout          | Specification Tree | judges shape against it                                                             | every reader and tool finds a corpus alike; old trees need migration  |
| layout          | a recorded layout  | judges shape against that record, reporting each departure as an adoption gap       | existing paths and bindings keep working; readers learn a local shape |
| structure check | adopted            | carries the check's results verbatim; missing evidence for this revision is pending | exact and repeatable; the adopter maintains the check                 |
| structure check | none               | records existence, counts, tree shape, and link resolution as not run               | nothing to maintain; those categories stay unverified in each report  |

With no layout recorded, it applies
[Specification Tree](../../repo-governance/conventions/structure/specification-tree.md) and reports the missing
decision.

## What It Judges

[Validating Specification Structure](../skills/validating-specification-structure/SKILL.md) carries the judgement and
typical level for each category:

1. **Index quality.** Each index says what its folder holds, per
   [Directory Indexes](../../repo-governance/conventions/structure/directory-indexes.md).
2. **Feature format.** Headers, user stories, shared preconditions, and naming, per
   [Discovery and Scenarios](../../repo-governance/development/quality/testing/behaviour-driven-development/001-discovery-and-scenarios.md).
3. **Cross-folder consistency.** Counterpart folders state shared rules, actors, and entities alike.
4. **Architecture views.** The as-built document agrees with itself across levels, per
   [Architecture Specifications](../../repo-governance/development/quality/architecture/architecture-specifications.md),
   with colour judged by [Color Accessibility](../../repo-governance/conventions/writing/color-accessibility.md).
5. **References.** Each target still holds what the text claims it holds.
6. **Implementation alignment.** Each implementation a specification names exists.

An owner without behaviour specifications or a served contract is reported as an adoption gap for its owner to decide,
never as a defect.

## Findings

Each finding names the folder, the file and location, the category, the rule it breaks, what was observed, and its
criticality under
[Criticality Levels](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/001-criticality-levels.md).
The checker returns the structure check's results first, then its findings and how many folders and files it read, to
its caller; zero read is never a clean result. Accepted false positives the caller supplies are noted and left out of
the count.

## Shell

`shell` lists files, runs the repository's structure and link checks in a form that changes nothing, and confirms that
named implementation paths exist. It never runs a test suite.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every listed folder has been audited once and its findings and counts are returned, or when a listed
folder cannot be read, reporting it as not run.

## What It Does Not Do

It never edits a file, audits an unlisted folder, counts features or resolves links by hand in place of an adopted
check, decides adoption, runs tests, or judges whether a statement is complete and testable. What each binding asserts
belongs to [Gherkin Implementation Reviewer](gherkin-implementation-reviewer.md), and repairs to
[Specs Fixer](specs-fixer.md).
