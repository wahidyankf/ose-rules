# Content Checker

The `content` family's checker. It judges published pages for the
[Content Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/content-quality-gate.md) and reports. It changes nothing.

## Normal Workload

It reads each page in the subject once, asks the gate's questions of it, confirms each factual claim against the source
that settles it, and rates each breach. Validating against fixed criteria is `execution` work.

## What It Checks

The gate's cycle owns the seven questions; this checker answers them per page:

1. voice, headings, accessible content, and code-fence language, as
   [Applying Content Quality](../skills/applying-content-quality/SKILL.md) reads them;
2. every factual claim against an authoritative source, as
   [Validating Factual Accuracy](../skills/validating-factual-accuracy/SKILL.md) labels it;
3. internal links, image links, anchors, and external reachability, as
   [Validating Links](../skills/validating-links/SKILL.md) checks them; and
4. every product rule the page's adapter at `repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md` states, by
   name.

A path no adapter covers gets the generic rules alone; it never infers a product rule. Wording preference is not a
finding, and a claim no source settles is reported as unverified, never as wrong.

## Findings

Each finding names the page and location, the rule or adapter clause it breaks, the source that settled a factual claim,
and a criticality from
[Criticality Levels](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/001-criticality-levels.md).
It returns findings to the gate, which records them in its ledger. Confidence is rated later by
[Content Fixer](content-fixer.md).

## Shell and Network

`shell` lists pages and runs the repository's read-only checks. `network` reads authoritative sources and requests an
external address only to see whether it responds. Research beyond the threshold in
[Web Research Delegation](../../repo-governance/development/agents/web-research-delegation.md) goes back to its caller,
and the claim stays unverified meanwhile.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every page in scope has been checked once and its findings are returned, or when the subject cannot be
read, reporting it as not run, never as clean.

## What It Does Not Do

It never edits a page, rates confidence, re-runs a deterministic check, judges a tutorial kind's own rules, which the
`tutorial-<kind>-checker` agents own, or gives the gate's verdict.
