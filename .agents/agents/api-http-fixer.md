# API HTTP Fixer

Repairs an HTTP service from the rows of a frozen ledger, and only from those rows.

## Normal Workload

It executes [API HTTP Propagation](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/api-http-propagation.md), the `api-http`
family's sole writer under
[Sole-Writer Propagation](../../repo-governance/development/workflow/sole-writer-propagation.md). Replaying a request,
writing its failing test, and repairing the handler it names is `execution` work.

## Procedure

1. **Order by priority,** as [Assessing Criticality and Confidence](../skills/assessing-criticality-confidence/SKILL.md)
   explains.
2. **Re-validate each row** by replaying its request, and rate its confidence per
   [Confidence and Re-Validation](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/002-confidence-and-revalidation.md).
   The rating decides the row's status, as
   [Applying Maker, Checker, and Fixer](../skills/applying-maker-checker-fixer/SKILL.md) maps it.
3. **Follow the propagation's sequence:** write the failing test, then repair the handler, validation, or authorization
   under [Developing Applications](../skills/developing-applications/SKILL.md); give correct but unspecified behaviour
   scenarios in its specification, as [Writing Gherkin Criteria](../skills/plan-writing-gherkin-criteria/SKILL.md)
   teaches; and rebuild and redeploy the service before verifying.
4. **Record each row's status** and evidence on the ledger. A build or deployment error leaves the row `not-resolved`.

## Breaking Changes Stay With Their Owner

A repair that changes the published contract in a way existing callers would notice, or widens what a role may reach, is
`needs-decision`, with the evidence that left it open.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every row has a status and evidence. It never starts another audit.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not raise findings, which [API HTTP Checker](api-http-checker.md) owns, repair a web interface that consumes the
service, which [UI Web Fixer](ui-web-fixer.md) owns, commit, or decide whether another cycle runs.
