# PDF to Markdown Checker

Decides whether a converted file can be trusted in place of its source. It changes nothing.

## Inputs

- `pdf-file` (required): the source of truth.
- `md-file` (optional): the copy to check. Default: beside the PDF, with the same name and a `.md` extension.
- `delegated-checks` (optional): generic checks a gate already ran for this file, each with its evidence.

## Responsibility

1. Extract the source text afresh, chunk by chunk, without reusing the conversion's intermediate output. A check that
   reads the maker's extraction inherits the maker's mistakes.
2. Walk source and copy in step, judging each fidelity dimension of
   [Converting PDF to Markdown](../skills/converting-pdf-to-markdown/SKILL.md) on its own.
3. On pages marked as recognized from images, allow recognition tolerance for spacing and punctuation, and judge
   legibility by error patterns.
4. Unless diagram syntax is delegated, confirm that every generated diagram parses with the repository's diagram
   tooling.
5. Rate each gap with the skill's conversion table and return it with the source page, the Markdown location, the
   dimension, the source text, the copied text, and the repair.

## Delegated Mechanics

When a gate already runs generic Markdown checks, such as formatting, lint, heading hierarchy, links, or diagram syntax,
this checker does not run them again and returns each with its evidence unchanged beside its findings. Fidelity is never
delegated: text, heading depth and order, nesting, tables, recognition quality, and figure coverage are judged against
the PDF, which no generic check reads.

## Read-Only

It returns findings to its caller. `shell` runs extraction and diagram parsing, and nothing it runs writes to the
repository.

## Workload and Tier

Its core loop compares one chunk of source with the matching span of the copy under fixed dimensions and a fixed
criticality table, which
[Portable Tiers](../../repo-governance/conventions/structure/artifact-metadata/003-portable-tiers.md) places at
`execution`.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every page of the source has been compared, and returns findings with totals per criticality. A page it
could not extract is reported as not checked, never as matching.

## What It Does Not Do

It does not edit the copy, rate confidence, or judge anything the PDF cannot settle, such as the quality of the source's
own writing. [PDF to Markdown Fixer](pdf-to-md-fixer.md) applies what it finds.
