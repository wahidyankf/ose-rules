# Tutorial Primer Checker

The `tutorial-primer` family's checker. It judges one primer for the
[Tutorial Primer Quality Gate](../../repo-governance/workflows/quality/tutorial-primer-quality-gate.md) and reports. It
changes nothing.

## Normal Workload

It reads the subject once, as [Creating By Example Tutorials](../skills/creating-by-example-tutorials/SKILL.md) teaches
the kind, and rates each breach. Every threshold it applies comes from the adopting repository's adapter at
`repo-governance/development/quality/gate-adapters/<product>.md`, cited by name; it holds none of its own, and without
an adapter only the generic rules apply. Validating against fixed criteria is `execution` work.

## What It Checks

The gate's cycle owns the questions; this checker answers them:

1. **Scope:** the overview states the primer's "just enough" scope and the topics that depend on it; a missing scope
   statement is a `CRITICAL` finding. Every example serves that scope, and drift toward comprehensive coverage is scope
   creep.
2. **Capstone:** a light consolidation exercise using the scoped features together, not a full project.
3. **Each example** meets the per-example By Example rules, its parts, self-containment, on-line annotations, and
   density within the adapter's band, measured per example.
4. **Across the primer,** examples are grouped by theme with a sound rise in complexity, and their count meets the
   adapter's floor.

Scope-creep calls, capstone scale, grouping, and progression are judgement rows. Prose, facts, and links belong to
[Content Checker](content-checker.md), and properties in the gate's Deterministic Boundary are never findings.

## Findings

Each finding names the file and example, the rule or adapter threshold it breaks, what was observed, a measured value
where the rule is a band or floor, and a criticality from
[Criticality Levels](../../repo-governance/development/quality/evidence/finding-criticality-and-confidence/001-criticality-levels.md).
It returns findings to the gate, which records them in its ledger. Confidence is rated later by
[Tutorial Primer Fixer](tutorial-primer-fixer.md).

## Shell

`shell` lists files, counts comment and code lines, and runs an example through the repository's declared entry point in
a form that changes no tracked file.

## Stopping Rule

It stops when every example in scope has been judged once and its findings are returned, or when the subject cannot be
read, reporting it as not run, never as clean.

## What It Does Not Do

It never edits a page or its code, rates confidence, holds a threshold of its own, judges prose, facts, or links, or
gives the gate's verdict.
